# Sentiment Analysis with NLTK üìù
This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on text data using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The project is designed for data scientists, machine learning enthusiasts, and NLP practitioners interested in text analysis.

## Key Features:
- Data Preparation: Load, clean, and preprocess text data.
- Sentiment Analysis: Leverage NLTK's tools for sentiment classification, including VADER or Naive Bayes.
- Model Training: Train sentiment analysis models on labeled datasets.
- Evaluation: Assess model performance with metrics and visualizations.
-  Interactive: Fully documented code with inline explanations and visual outputs.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: nltk, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn

#### Sample Results:
- Graphical representations of sentiment distribution.
- Metrics to evaluate classifier performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

Feel free to contribute, report issues, or use this as a foundation for your sentiment analysis projects!
